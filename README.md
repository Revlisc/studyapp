An app made in collaboration to allow for a user to make flashcard sets for studying. We modeled 
the app off of the "desktopStudy" project but utilized skills in React Native to make it adapted for mobile.
Allowing for the same functionality, a user can login or sign up, create or edit sets, and review themselves on
subject mastery!
